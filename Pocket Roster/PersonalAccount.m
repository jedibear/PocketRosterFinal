 * This is a new aspect of the site I began but have not had time 
 * to get up to speed, although it was getting close 
 *
 * This code takes in the Bowdoin Log in username (Log info provided by 
 * Andrew Currier) and based on that I created a test txt file that would 
 * take it and pull if you were an athlete if so you name, grade, event, photo, and 
 * other variables like who your following whos following you etc. 
 * Its the big thing I will work on next year getting that to work will be my goal and 
 * The final piece to this project before app store
